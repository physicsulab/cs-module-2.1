    "A lot of the time when you're writing long chunks of code, you'll notice that some of the lines seem a bit redundant. Maybe you're changing one number or one string or some particular input at a time, but at the same time, you're not able to use a loop to reduce the number of lines you write because the offending \"repetitive\" lines are far apart from each other. For example, you have a dataset in which all of the columns are in string form, but as you begin analysis on one column, you would like to be able to convert all of the values in it to a different type.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, if you are dealing with a <i>Pandas dataframe</i> -- Pandas is a Python library for data science and manipulation, and a dataframe is the standard structure of table storage within Pandas -- a method that can be used to convert column data types follows the general skeleton <code>[column].astype([type])</code> in that if you would like to convert a column assigned to the variable <code>ex_column</code> to <code>int</code> values, you could reassign <code>ex_column</code> to <code>ex_column.astype('int64')</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The <code>astype</code> name here represents a function. Just as variables and their data types are the nouns of programming, so functions are the verbs, actions in series of lines that can be performed upon <i>objects</i> (variables, numbers, strings, even other functions, etc.) called <i>parameters</i>. In the previous Module, we went over the basics of what a function is, and explored some built-in functions, as well as the difference between <i>pure</i> and <i>non-pure</i>, a distinguishment based on whether or not the function returns a value. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, functions like <code>astype</code> and <code>print</code> and <code>abs</code> are all built-in functions, and built-in functions have a limited range of capabilities. What if you need to write your own custom function to handle something specific to your needs that a simple import of a library or built-in functions cannot perform on their own?\n",
    "\n",
    "You can define a function in Python using the following basic template:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def [function_name](... parameters ...):\n",
    "    [lines of code that may include manipulations using parameter names]\n",
    "    optional: return a value ex. return x\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's walk through what's going on in the block of code above. The Python keyword <code>def</code> signifies the start of a function definition, similar to defining a variable, with <code>[name] = </code> being an analogy to <code>def [function_name]</code>. After the function name, the parameters of the function are listed separated by commas within parentheses. The names of the parameters can be anything, but they should be descriptive placeholders for the values that the programmer expects there to be when the function is called.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the body of the function, which should be indented consistently from the encapsulating definition line, you can include code or calculations that might concern one or more of the parameters passed through. For example, if a parameter to a function <code>square</code> (which will give back the square of <code>n</code>) is <code>n</code>, a line inside the function to calculate the square could be <code>square = n ** 2</code>. Notice that the calculations and lines are all written in terms of the parameters. However, this means that the parameter variable names only have local scope i.e. you can't write <code>print(n)</code> outside the function in which it is defined because the computer won't know what it is. The name <code>n</code> is defined inside <code>square</code> and discarded as soon as the function finishes running.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example of a fully defined function:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def n_sum(n):\n",
    "    total = 0\n",
    "    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n",
    "        total += i\n",
    "    print(\"Now we're done!\")\n",
    "    return total\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you think this function does? What will it print for different input values to <code>n</code>?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you know how to define a function. But that's not very useful unless you also know how to call it! In fact, calling your own function works in exactly the same way as calling a built-in function or an imported function. If you define the function in the current environment, you can simply call it on some input <i>arguments</i> in the following way: <code>[function_name](... arguments ...)</code>. You will lose that function as soon as you exit the created Python environment (which is why whenever you reopen a Jupyter notebook, the kernel restarts and you have to rerun all of the cells). The cool thing about Jupyter notebook is that you also have the code for your functions saved in cells, which makes rerunning more convenient than copy-pasting within the terminal. However, if your function is in a different file and you want to import it into your Python environment, you can simply run the line <code>import [file_name]</code> and reference the function as <code>[file_name].[function_name](... arguments ...)</code> from then on or (a simpler and recommended method), you can import the function you need specifically from the file: <code>from [file_name] import [function_name]</code> and from then on, the function can be called in the format <code>[function_name](... arguments ...)</code> which is often much more convenient.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Note</b>: Also, this little tidbit isn't just relevant to this problem, but it might be useful in terms of shorthand in future ones. When you want to increment a variable, there are two main ways you can go about doing this in Python. Assuming the variable <code>x</code> is something you want to increase by 5, one command is <code>x = x + 5</code> and the other which means the same thing but compresses the number of characters you use is <code>x += 5</code>. Replace 5 with any incrementing number and <code>x</code> with any variable and the template still holds! You can also change the operation to $-$, $*$ or even $/$ if you want to divide in place, for example, and you can replace the positive number with a negative one, or even a float."

   "source": [
    "A <i>nested function</i> is a function that is defined inside of another function. Often, this is referred to as a type of helper function, performing intermediate calculations before the final result is returned. There are 3 main reasons a programmer may use nested functions in their code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) <i>Encapsulation</i>. This is an important idea in CS in which individual functions or classes are defined specifically do their own jobs and call each other instead of having one function do the work of multiple. This is a superior way of designing code that increases readability. Encapsulation relates to nested functions specifically because you can have inner functions inside a larger one to protect them from being in global scope, where they might not be necessary and names might conflict or be overwritten. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<code>\n",
    "def outer(x, y):\n",
    "    def inner_mult(x, y):\n",
    "        return x * y\n",
    "    return inner_mult(x, y) + inner_mult(x, y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "def inner_mult(x, y):\n",
    "    return x * y\n",
    "</code>\n",
    "\n",
    "Just because another function <code>inner_mult</code> is defined outside the function <code>outer</code> doesn't mean both functions with the same name overwrite each other. The <i>scope</i> of inner_mult is global because it isn't inside another function. Global scope means that you can access the function from any part of your program. However, the scope of the <code>inner_mult</code> is limited to anywhere inside the <code>outer</code> function, which keeps it from being overwritten by the global <code>inner_mult</code>. When <code>outer(4, 5)</code> is called, <code>inner_mult(4, 5) + inner_mult(4, 5)</code> will be returned where <code>inner_mult</code> is the one nested in <code>outer_mult</code>. This is exactly what we expect!\n",
    "\n",
    "2) <i>Abstraction</i>. Say you want to make your function robust and throw errors when an unexpected input is passed through. You can nest a function inside the main function that handles and validates inputs before any operations or calculations are performed. In most cases, you could un-nest this function and widen its scope to global so that you can extend its capabilities to multiple functions, but if a function has special inputs that make it different from the others in your file, nesting might be a good idea. You might have to deal with nesting validation functions when you're cleaning up messy, unformatted data before you begin to apply your astrophysics knowledge!\n",
    "\n",
    "3) <i>Closures</i>. A closure is a situation in which the inner function \"remembers\" the values defined / set in its outer scope when it's called. This might be confusing to conceptualize, so take a look at example below:"

This time gets longer and longer as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ (i.e. for very large datasets).
